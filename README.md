### Elevating FRC Java Robot Simulations to the Next Level with Physics Engines

## Why a Physics Engine?
A simulation engine is a powerful tool that provides realistic approximations of physical systems. With **maple-sim**, we integrate the open-source Java rigid-body dynamics engine, [dyn4j](https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j), capable of simulating 2D forces and collisions between rigid shapes. This integration transforms the scope of robot simulations by enabling realistic interactions between robots, field elements, and game pieces.

Before **maple-sim**, most FRC robot simulations focused solely on the robot itself‚Äîits sensors, movements, and internal operations. 
Now, through the power of physics simulation, **maple-sim** allows your robot to engage directly with its environment. 
Imagine testing robot interactions with obstacles, field elements, and game pieces, all within the simulated world.
A simulation that is realistic enough to **feel like a video game.**

With this advanced level of simulation, the possibilities are endless. You can:

- Test autonomous modes with pinpoint accuracy.
- Fine-tune advanced TeleOp enhancement features like pathfinding-auto-alignment.
- Optimize shooters and other subsystems, all while gathering meaningful data from simulated physics.

**And the best part? You can achieve all of this without needing a real robot on hand.**
