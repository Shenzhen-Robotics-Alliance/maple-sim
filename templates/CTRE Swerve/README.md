# CTRE Swerve Drive

### With more enhanced swerve drive simulation using [maple-sim](https://github.com/Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/maple-sim).

Original Project is [here](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix6-Examples/tree/main/java/SwerveWithPathPlanner).

> 🙏 This solution is inspired by [BreakerLib Sim](https://github.com/BreakerBots/BRICK/blob/main/2025-beta/src/main/java/frc/robot/BreakerLib/swerve/BreakerSimSwerveDrivetrain.java).  Big thanks to [Team 5104, The Breakerbots](https://github.com/BreakerBots) for sharing the work.
